hello 
the Code is inside "Project"
We created an executable file of our program hope you like it(the DigiLearn.xml should be in the same folder as DigiLearn.exe).
for the program to run it needs a directory in "C:" called DigiLearn so the path should look like "C:/DigiLearn".
Just copy and past the folder provided into "C:".
AFTER READING THIS YOU SHOULD READ : ReadMe Second.txt inside of DigiLearn Dir
